# Progress log

Spec: `docs/SPEC.md`. Inventory: `docs/INVENTORY.md`.

Local tooling: PHP 8.3 CLI installed via winget (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\PHP.PHP.8.3_*\php.exe`), run with a custom php.ini (pdo_mysql, gd, fileinfo, mbstring, openssl enabled). Headless Chrome is used for screenshots.

## Phase 1 — foundation and PHP conversion ✅

**Done**
- Saved the spec, wrote INVENTORY.md, and took baseline screenshots (9 pages × 375/768/1024/1440).
- Foundation in `app/`: bootstrap, db (PDO), helpers, settings, images, content, render, schema.sql, seed.php.
- Partials: head, header, cta-footer, footer-only (+ shared footer-grid), project-card, icons.
- All 9 pages converted to PHP with clean URLs. Dynamic parts: contact data, stats, home projects, service-page experience, markets related projects, projects page, image slots.
- Added careers.php (hero, intro, openings / empty state), 404.php, sitemap.php (/sitemap.xml), and robots.php (/robots.txt).
- Root `.htaccess` (HTTPS, canonical host, clean URLs, 301s from .html and .php, deny rules, compression, caching). Added `.htaccess` deny files for `app/`, `storage/`, and `uploads/` (images only, no scripts).
- Old `.html` files removed; the 301 redirects cover the old URLs.
- The form plumbing (csrf.php, ratelimit.php, mail.php, PHPMailer 6.9.3, both submit handlers, form JS) was written early in this phase while MariaDB downloaded. Phase 2 finishes and tests it.

**Checks**
- `php -l` passes on all PHP files.
- Local run: portable MariaDB 10.11 + `php -S` with a router that mirrors `.htaccess` (scratchpad only).
- Normalized HTML diff of every page against the originals: identical except the Careers nav/footer links, form wiring, and the two notes below.
- Screenshot diff at 4 widths: changes only in the header (Careers item) and the footer (one more Menu line, so the page is taller).

**Decisions**
- `pages.page_key` is used instead of `key`, because `key` is a reserved word in MySQL.
- Each service page shows different titles, text, and order for the same project, so these are stored per service in `project_services` (`sort_order`, `card_title`, `card_summary`). `projects.primary_service` sets the single tag shown on the Projects page.
- The Markets page images are page_images slots (`markets/{market}`).
- Header fit:
  - Nav gaps are now 20/18px for widths up to 1199px (this used to apply only up to 1079px).
  - The hamburger menu now appears below 1024px (was 960px); `main.js` mobileQuery was updated to match. Without these changes, the header ran out of room at about 960px and 1080px once a desktop scrollbar was present.
- `hero-careers.jpg` could not be AI-generated here (no image generation tool), so it is a copy of `hero-about.jpg`, marked as a placeholder.
- Accepted differences from the original pages:
  - On the utilities page, the Bartow card meta now reads "BARTOW COUNTY, GA • COMPLETED" (it had no status before).
  - Markets › Municipal related projects follow the global project order (rebuild, bartow, rehab).
- `picture { display: contents; }` was added so uploaded WebP images keep the existing layout.
